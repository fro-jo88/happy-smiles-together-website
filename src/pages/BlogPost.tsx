    title: "How Water Filters Change Lives",

      <p>Access to clean water is something many of us take for granted, but in parts of Western Kenya, it remains a daily challenge that impacts health, education, and economic opportunities.</p>
      
      <p>Through our Water Filter Program, HappyMeHappyYou has been working to transform this reality for hundreds of families. The simple technology of ceramic water filters is making an extraordinary difference in communities across the region.</p>
      
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      
      <p>Many families in Western Kenya rely on water sources that are contaminated with bacteria and parasites. This leads to frequent waterborne illnesses, especially among children, causing:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Missed school days and decreased academic performance</li>
        <li>Medical expenses that strain already limited family resources</li>
        <li>Reduced work productivity for adults</li>
        <li>In severe cases, preventable deaths, particularly among young children</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      
      <p>Our ceramic water filters are:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Effective at removing 99.9% of bacteria and parasites</li>
        <li>Locally manufactured, supporting the regional economy</li>
        <li>Simple to use and maintain</li>
        <li>Durable, lasting up to 2-3 years with proper care</li>
        <li>Cost-effective at approximately $25 per filter, which serves a family of 5-7 people</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Impact</h2>
      
      <p>Since launching this program, we've distributed over 500 water filters, impacting approximately 3,000 individuals. The results have been remarkable:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>85% reduction in reported cases of diarrheal diseases in recipient families</li>
        <li>42% reduction in school absences among children from these households</li>
        <li>Families report saving an average of $15 per month on medical expenses</li>
        <li>Women and girls save 1-2 hours daily that was previously spent collecting and treating water</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>These statistics represent real improvements in quality of life and opportunities for these communities.</p>
      
      <h2>Meet Sarah's Family</h2>
      
      <p>Sarah, a mother of four in Kakamega County, received a water filter six months ago. Before the filter, her children were frequently ill with stomach problems, and she spent a significant portion of her limited income on medication and hospital visits.</p>
      
      <p>"The water filter has changed everything for us," she shares. "My children are healthier and attending school regularly. I'm able to save money and even start a small vegetable garden with the time I used to spend boiling water."</p>
      
      <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
      
      <p>A donation of $25 provides a water filter for one family, creating immediate health benefits and long-term opportunities. Join us in making clean water accessible to more families in Western Kenya.</p>
